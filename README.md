# Push Swap

## Description
Push Swap is a project at 42 school aimed at sorting a stack of integers with the smallest possible number of instructions, using two stacks and a limited set of operations.

## Requirements
- The project should be implemented in C.
- It should adhere to the 42 coding standards.
- The program should be able to handle a stack of integers provided as arguments.
- The sorting algorithm should minimize the number of instructions used.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stefansige/push_swap.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd push_swap
   ```

3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Run the program with a list of integers to be sorted:
   ```bash
   ./push_swap 4 2 5 1 3
   ```

## Algorithm
The push_swap program uses a combination of sorting algorithms to efficiently sort the stack. It employs techniques like insertion sort, selection sort, and merge sort to minimize the number of instructions required.

## Additional Notes
- The `push_swap` program outputs a series of instructions to sort the stack.
